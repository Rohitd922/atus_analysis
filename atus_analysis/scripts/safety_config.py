SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always start with a single rung test: --mode single --rung R1
2. Monitor system resources during execution
3. Use conservative delays (â‰¥120s) between rungs
4. Ensure at least 8GB free memory before starting
5. Avoid running during heavy system usage
6. Keep progress files for resuming interrupted runs
7. Run routing ladder first before full experiments
